Q1)
Why do I need to override the equals and hashCode methods in Java?
ans: You must override hashCode() in every class that overrides equals(). Failure to do so will 
result in a violation of the general contract for Object.hashCode(), which will prevent your class 
from functioning properly in conjunction with all hash-based collections, 
including HashMap, HashSet, and Hashtable.
